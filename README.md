# About RunCalc
This is a simple calculator for runners. It allows you to calculate distance, pace or time based on other two parameters to plan
your training sessions or set goals for competitions.

I've made it, because I believe that other calculators that I've tried are way too complex and not easy to use and friendly enough.

If you find this project usefult, please conribute by proposing new features, reporting bugs or writing code.
